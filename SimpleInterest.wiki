invest $100 at 3% for 2 years

I=100*.03*2

We made $6!!!

We have a total of $106

We have two student loans, one at 5% and the other at 8%. The total amount is
12,000 plus 750 interest. What is the amount of each loan?

I1=a*.05

I2=b*0.8

a+b=12,000

I1+I2=750

a=7000
b=5000

another problem

.03a+.04b=176

a+b=5000

.03(5000-b)+.04b=176

150+.01b=176

.01b=26

b=2600
