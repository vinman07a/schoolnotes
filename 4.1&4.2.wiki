# [[Polynomials]] Functions

f(x) = 1+x^2+5x^3-7x^4

- degree = 4
	- highest power
- leading term = -7x^4
- leading coefficient = -7
- y-intercept = (0,0)
	- solve for x=0

## Even Degree

- if the leading coefficient is positive then it the parabola opens upwards, if
negative it opens down

## Odd Degree
