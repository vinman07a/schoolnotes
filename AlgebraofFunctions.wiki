# Domains

f(x)=2x+3
This function is a line because the highest degree is 1
the domain is all real Numbers

g(x)=\frac{1}{x}
domain is all reals not equal to 0

(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)
the domain is all reals not equal to 0

(f-g)(x)=2x+3-1/x
domain is still all reals!= 0

## As long as x is in the denominator it cant be 0

(f*g)(x)=(2x+3)*(1/x)=2+3/x
*DOMAIN IS THE SAME*

(f/g)(x)=\frac{2x+3}{1/x}=(2x+3)*x=2x^{2}+3x
domain is still all reals != 0 because at the beginning there is 1/x!!!

(g/f)(x)=\frac{1/x}{2x+3}=1/x*1/(2x+3)=1/(2^{2}+3x)
domain is all reals not equal to 0 *or* -3/2

# Composition of Functions

f of g of x... **scary**

can also be written as f(g(x)) or (fog)(x)

2(1/x)+3=2/x+3

can you guess the domain???

we can also do g(f(x))
g(2x+3)=1/(2x+3)
domain is all reals not equal to -3/2

g(f(0))
f(0)=2(0)+3=3
g(3)=1/3

## *NOW FOR NEW FUNCTIONS*

f(x)=\sqrt{x}
 domain is all reals greater than 0

g(x)=x-4
domain is all reals

(f+g)(9)=8

(f/g)(4)=2/0=undefined

(f/g)(x)
domain is all reals not equal to for which are greater than or equal to 0
d=[0,4)U(4,\inf]

(g*f)(12)=8\sqrt{12}=16\sqrt{3}

(f-g)(16)=-8

f(g(x))=\sqrt{x-4}
domain is all reals greater than or equal to 4

## New functions now!

f(x)=\sqrt{x}
domain is all reals grater  than 0

g(x)=\sqrt{x^{2}-4}
domain is all reals greater than 2 or less than -2

g(f(x))=\sqrt{x}-4
domain is all reals greater than 0

f(g(2))=0

g(f(1))=-3

g(f(7))=3

# Difference Quotient

\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}

Same thing as slope

## construct and simplify the difference quotient

f(x)=5x+3
[(5x+5h+3)-(5x+3)]/h
[5h]/h
5

f(x)=4-3x
[(4-3x-3h)-(4-3x)]/h
-3h/h
-3

g(x)=x^{2}-3x
This is a parabola
{[(x+h)^{2}-3(x+h)]-(x^{2}-3x)}/h
(2xh+h6{2}-3h)
2x+h-3

f(x)=\sqrt{2x}
[(\sqrt{2x+2h})-(\sqrt{2x})]/h
cannot be simplified more!!
