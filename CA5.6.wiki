# Exponential Growth

## p(t) = p(o*e^{kt})

- o = initial amount
- t = time 

## A = P(1+(r/n))^nt

## Examples

- In 2006 the population of China was 1.314 billion with yearly growth rate of .6% forh
	- growth function = 1.314e^{.0006t}
	- find the setimated population in 2010
		- 1.3459
	- when will the population double?

- $1500 invested at 5.5% compounded continuously
	- How much will be in the account in 3 years
		- 
- $2000 invested and compounded continuously and will grow to 2504.65 in 5
years
	- Find the interest rate
		- 
- 10,000$ invested at 2.75%
	- A = 10000(1+(.0275/12))^t*12
	- How much will you have in 3 years?
		- 10858$
- 1200 invested at 5% compounded quarterly
	- 
	- How long will it take to have $2400?
		- 2000
