# Why do you think the empire collapsed?

The Mughal Empire collapsed because of religious tensions, incompetant
leadership and British colonization. All empires have a rise and fall. One of
the greatest issues of the Mughals towards the end was their religion, the
leadership attempted to impose it on all of the lands which  they conquered.
The Mughals also lost out in India to the British. Every nation the leadership
of which is hereditary faces the issue of incompitency and entitled leaders.

# What are some strengths and weaknesses of the Mughal empire.

The Mughal Empire had many strengths and weaknesses. A great strength of theirs
was religious tolerence, this was lost by later leaders. The early leaders were
known for their cunning. The empire eventually fell due to hereditary rule,
this was it's greatest weakness.
