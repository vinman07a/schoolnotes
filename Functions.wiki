- [[Relations]]

A function is a relation where no 2 x are the same

y=2x^2+3 is a function

f(x)=2x^2+3

f(4)=35
(4,35)

f(x) defines function f

y^2=x is not a function, when y is square it is a sideways parabola.

(-2,-6)(-1,0)(0,0)(1,0)(2,6)
domain=all real [[Numbers]]
range=all real [[Numbers]]

An asemtote is an imaginary line that a curve is getting infinitely close to.

y=x^2-1

f(x)=1/x+2
domain=all reals != -2 (the denominator cannot be equal to 2)

f(x)=\sqroot(x)
domain= all reals >= -3

f(x)=cubed root of x
domain= all real Numbers

domain is all reals unless:
- x in denominator: x must be !=0
- square root of x: x must be >=0

f(x)= x^3 + |x|
domain=all reals

f(x)=x^-1+3x
domain = all reals != 0

f(x)=\sqrt(2x-3)
domain= all reals greater than or equal to 3/2
