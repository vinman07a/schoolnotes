## Intervals
only x values
only parentheses
left to right

## Relative Maximum and Relative Minimum

Relative maximum is the highest point in a line from which the line goes down on both sides

Relative minimum is the highest point in a line from which the line goes down
up both sides

(-1,1)(2,-1)(4,2)(6,-4]

domain = (-\inf,6]
range = [-4,\inf]
Interval of Increase = (2,2)
Interval of Decrease = (4,6)(-\inf,-1)
Relative Max = (4,2)
Relative Min = (6,-4)

f(x)=-.09x^{3}+.5x^{2}-.1x+1
domain = (-\inf,6]
range = [-4,\inf]
Interval of Increase = (2,2)
Interval of Decrease = (4,6)(-\inf,-1)
Relative Max = (4,2)
Relative Min = (6,-4)
